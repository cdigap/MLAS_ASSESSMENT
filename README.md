# MLAS_ASSESSMENT
Machine learning and statistics - Assessment


This assessment concerns the well-known Boston House Prices dataset and the Python packages scipy, keras, and jupyter. 
This assessment includes creating a Jupyter notebook with 
1)	descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Dataset, 
2)	Inferential statistics to analyse the data and infer if there is a significant different between the median house prices between houses near Charles river and which are not.
3) Creating a neural network that can predict the house prices.
