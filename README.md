# MLAS_ASSESSMENT
Machine learning and statistics - Assessment


This assessment concerns the well-known Boston House Prices dataset and the Python packages scipy, keras, and jupyter. 
This assessment includes creating a Jupyter notebook with 
1)	Descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Dataset, 
2)	Inferential statistics to analyse the data and infer if there is a significant different between the median house prices between houses near Charles river and which are not.
3) Creating a neural network that can predict the house prices.

## What is Boston Dataset :

This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. It was obtained from the StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston), and has been used extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms.

### Desciptive Statistics - 
  Loading a CSV file and assigning the headers to the file.
  
  Showing how any records are there in the file and what type of data does it have.
  
  Describing the Data file which will give the statistical details as the Mean, Standard deviation, Minimum, Maximum etc.
  
  Checking for NULL in the data file.
  

### Inferential Statistics
Doing this excercise we found that the number of houses near the Charles River are less compared to the houses far from the river. But the houses near the River are expensive on average than the houses away from the river. 

### Keras Neural network
This is totally new to me Tried to create a neural network.
